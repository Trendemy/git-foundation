## ðŸ“˜ Git Practice Tasks for Students

Each student will work on the same shared repository following this plan:

### **Step 1: Basic Git Flow**
- Clone the repo.
- Create a branch named `feature/<your-name>`.
- Edit `index.html` to add your personal intro.
- Make at least 2 meaningful commits.
- Push your branch and create a Pull Request.

---

### **Step 2: Collaboration**
- Pull changes made by others.
- Resolve at least 1 merge conflict.
- Use `git log`, `git blame`, `git diff` to audit changes.
- Tag the project as `v1.0` once the first version is complete.

---

### **Step 3: Advanced Git**
- Create a commit with intentional mistake (e.g., delete a line).
- Use `git revert` to undo the change and explain the difference with `reset`.
- Review and merge someone elseâ€™s PR.

Would you like me to package this project as a downloadable `.zip` file, or push it to a GitHub repo you can clone right away?
